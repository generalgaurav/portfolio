     <p>Environment
        All living things that live on this earth comes under the environment. Whether
        they live on land or water they are part of the environment. The environment also
        includes air, water, sunlight, plants, animals, etc.
        Moreover, the earth is considered the only planet in the universe that supports
        life. The environment can be understood as a blanket that keeps life on the planet
        sage and sound.

        Importance of Environment
        We truly cannot understand the real worth of the environment. But we can
        estimate some of its importance that can help us understand its importance. It
        plays a vital role in keeping living things healthy in the environment.
        Likewise, it maintains the ecological balance that will keep check of life on earth.
        It provides food, shelter, air, and fulfills all the human needs whether big or small.
        Moreover, the entire life support of humans depends wholly on the
        environmental factors. In addition, it also helps in maintaining various life cycles
        on earth.
        Most importantly, our environment is the source of natural beauty and is
        necessary for maintaining physical and mental health.
        Benefits of the Environment
        The environment gives us countless benefits that we can’t repay our entire life.
        As they are connected with the forest, trees, animals, water, and air. The forest
        and trees filter the air and absorb harmful gases. Plants purify water, reduce the
        chances of flood maintain natural balance and many others.
        Moreover, the environment keeps a close check on the environment and its
        functioning, It regulates the vital systems that are essential for the ecosystem.
        Besides, it maintains the culture and quality of life on earth.
        The environment regulates various natural cycles that happen daily. These cycles
        help in maintaining the natural balance between living things and the
        environment. Disturbance of these things can ultimately affect the life cycle of
        humans and other living beings.
        The environment has helped us and other living beings to flourish and grow from
        thousands of years. The environment provides us fertile land, water, air, livestock
        and many essential things for survival.
        Cause of Environmental Degradation
        Human activities are the major cause of environmental degradation because
        most of the activity’s humans do harm the environment in some way. The
        activities of humans that causes environmental degradation is pollution,
        defective environmental policies, chemicals, greenhouse gases, global warming,
        ozone depletion, etc.
        All these affect the environment badly. Besides, these the overuse of natural
        resources will create a situation in the future there will be no resources for
        consumption. And the most basic necessity of living air will get so polluted that
        humans have to use bottled oxygen for breathing.
        Above all, increasing human activity is exerting more pressure on the surface of
        the earth which is causing many disasters in an unnatural form. Also, we are using
        the natural resources at a pace that within a few years they will vanish from the
        earth.
        To conclude, we can say that it is the environment that is keeping us alive.
        Without the blanket of environment, we won’t be able to survive.
        Moreover, the environment’s contribution to life cannot be repaid. Besides, still
        what the environment has done for us, in return we only have damaged and
        degraded it.Importance of Environment
